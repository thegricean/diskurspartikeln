\begin{abstract}

We present a series of experiments investigating the interaction between speakers’ choice of closely related evidential expressions and the respective strength of speaker commitment that is conveyed by choosing these particular linguistic devices. Specifically, we examine the extent to which listeners' interpretation of certain types of modals and their judgments about speaker commitment differ in strength compared to the epistemic use of \emph{must}, to the use of discourse particles, and to statements with no modals at all. We also probe speakers' production preferences for these different devices under varying evidential circumstances. On the one hand, the results of our experiments confirm differences already observed in the literature dealing with the expression of speaker commitment. On the other hand, our evidence suggests interesting parallel effects that shed some new light on traditional assumptions. We conclude that our experimental squib provides a good starting point for approaching theoretical debates on the nature of evidential expressions empirically.

\section{Introduction}

When speakers are certain about some fact expressed by a proposition \emph{q}, they are likely to communicate this fact with a simple declarative utterance, as in (\ref{bare}). When they want to convey epistemic uncertainty, they have different devices for doing so: adding a modal adverbial, such as \emph{probably} (\ref{prob}), or using a modal verb, such as \emph{might} (\ref{might}). Either option leaves open the possibility that \emph{q} is not true.

\begin{exe}
	\ex\label{english} \begin{xlist}
		\ex\label{bare} The coffee is cold.
		\ex\label{prob} The coffee is probably cold.
		\ex\label{might} The coffee might be cold.
		\ex\label{must} The coffee must be cold.
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}


While it is uncontroversial that in both (\ref{prob}) and (\ref{might}) epistemic uncertainty is conveyed by clearly lexical means, it is a hotly debated issue whether the uncertainty component communicated by (\ref{must}) reduces to the same interpretive mechanism. Note that the relative weakness of \emph{must} (i.e., it yields a weaker claim than (\ref{bare}), cf. \citep{karttunen1972}) is puzzling because \emph{must} serves as a strong modal of necessity. Under a quantificational treatment of modality, these necessity modals correspond to universal quantifiers over possible worlds. They assert that in every (relevant) possible world, the proposition \emph{q} holds. So in (\ref{must}), epistemic \emph{must} should assert that in every world compatible with the speaker's knowledge, the coffee is cold. Given that knowledge corresponds to justified true belief (i.e., that which is known cannot be otherwise), from (\ref{must}) it necessarily follows that the coffee is cold (i.e., it is not possible that the coffee is not cold).

At issue, then, is the failed inference from (\ref{must}) to (\ref{bare}): How could \emph{must q} not entail \emph{q}? If the coffee is necessarily cold, then surely it is cold. It appears that talking about what is \emph{necessarily} the case commits speakers to less than does talking about what is \emph{actually} the case. From a comprehension perspective: How do listeners understand that \emph{q} does not follow from \emph{must q}? Given this semantic puzzle, one could hypothesize that the weakness of epistemic \emph{must} need not derive from truth-conditional content (e.g., quantification over a limited set of possible worlds or presuppositions about evidence strength). Rather, the epistemic interpretation of \emph{must} may rely on contextual factors such as evidence strength and thus may involve extra (pragmatic) computational operations on the part of the listener.

Other languages have many more ways to convey weakened speaker commitment (for an overview, see \cite{Aikhenvald2004,Drubig2001,Nuyts2001}). Even if we restrict ourselves to the group of Germanic languages, we observe interesting differences. German, for instance, is an interesting comparison case to English. While many devices of expressing speaker certainty do not differ from English (examples \ref{bareG}-\ref{mustG} are the German equivalents to \ref{bare}, \ref{prob}, and \ref{must}), (\ref{wohlG}) is an example involving the discourse particle \emph{wohl} (\cite{Zimmermann 2004}). 

\begin{exe}
	\ex\label{german} \begin{xlist}
		\ex\label{bareG} Der Kaffee ist kalt geworden.
		\ex\label{probG} Der Kaffee ist vermutlich kalt geworden.
		\ex\label{mustG} Der Kaffee muss kalt geworden sein. 
		\ex\label{wohlG} Der Kaffee ist wohl kalt geworden.
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Discourse particles like \emph{wohl} organize the discourse by conveying the epistemic states of both the speaker and the hearer. What is interesting about (\ref{wohlG}) in our context is that discourse particles such as \emph{wohl}, although lexically encoding weakened speaker commitment, are not part of the propositional, truth-conditional content of an utterance, in contrast to modal adverbs such as \emph{vermutlich} (`presumably’). Consider the following examples by Zimmermann (2011: 2013).

(3) a. Max ist	ja auf See.
Max is	 part at sea
‘(As I and you assume) Max is at sea.’
b. Max ist doch auf See.
Max is	 part at sea
‘(As you should know) Max is at sea.’
c. Max ist wohl auf See.
Max is	part at	sea
‘(As you may know) Max is at sea.’

Roughly, \emph{ja} conveys that both the speaker and the hearer may already know the proposition, \emph{doch} expresses that the hearer should update his knowledge concerning the proposition, and \emph{wohl} articulates that the speaker merely assumes that the propositional content is true. Discourse particles are optional and thus leaving them out does not affect the truth conditions of a sentence. That is, all the variants in (4) are true iff Max is at sea regardless of what kind of speaker commitment is conveyed by the discourse particles.

(4) Max ist auf See { , ja, doch, wohl}.
‘Max is at sea /part.’

Just as the epistemic use of \emph{must} (\ref{must})/(\ref{mustG}), \emph{wohl} is thus a special case of expressing weakened speaker commitment. Specifically, \cite{Zimmermann2004, Zimmermann2008} has shown that this particular particle cannot affect the presuppositional domain of utterance interpretation, unlike modal adverbs such as \emph{vermutlich}. If \emph{wohl} contributed to the proposition semantically, its use in the following case should have the effect that the presupposition is an assumption rather than an actual state of affairs (capitals indicate focal stress):

(5)	a.	Peter	ist	\{ \#	wohl  	vermutlich\}	GESTERN	\\
		Peter	is		PRT     presumably	yesterday\\		
		nach	 Hamburg	 gefahren,	\\
		to	 Hamburg	 driven	\\		
	b.	… vielleicht fährt er		\\
		aber	auch erst MORGEN.\\
		‘but maybe he will only go 
		tomorrow.’
	
	
(5) indicates that only the modal adverb \emph{vermutlich} can be mapped onto the background of a structured proposition. In particular, only the modal adverb, and not the discourse particle, is felicitous given the continuation (5b), which expresses an assertion that is in conflict with the presupposition of the utterance without \emph{wohl} or \emph{vermutlich}. Based on such evidence, many researchers have argued that discourse particles like \emph{wohl}, although in principle synonymous with certain adverbs (here: \emph{vermutlich}), operate within a separate, `use-conditional' meaning dimension (cf. \cite{Gutzmann2015} 215-268 for more arguments).

Given this cross-linguistic sketch of expressions conveying different strengths of speaker commitment, the present experimental squib will address the following questions: (i) Under which evidential circumstances do speakers prefer to use which evidential devices? We will deal with this question in Section 3. (ii) Do listeners ascribe different strengths of speaker commitment to the use of these various linguistic devices? We will address this issue in Sections 4 and 5. Before we start with presenting the individual experiments on questions (i) and (ii), we first need to introduce our materials as connected to experimental data on evidence strength in general. These data will serve as the basis for what follows.



\section{Experiment 1: evidence strength}

In Exp.~1, we collected estimates of evidence strength.\footnote{The English version of this experiment can be viewed \href{https://web.stanford.edu/~justinek/modals_exp/evidence.html}{here}. The German version can be viewed \href{http://web.stanford.edu/~jdegen/cgi-bin/4_dp_priors_evidencestrength/evidence.html}{here}.} These estimates were used in the analysis of Experiments 2 and 3.

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}

For the English version, 40 native English speakers were recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing service. For the German version, 40 German native speakers were recruited through Clickworker's crowd-sourcing service. Both groups were compensated for their participation.

\subsubsection{Materials and procedure}

Participants rated the probability of a state of affairs $q$ given a piece of evidence $e$ by adjusting a slider on a scale with endpoints labeled ``impossible'' and ``absolutely certain.’’ On each trial, participants first saw the context sentence ``Imagine that you are at home.'' Then the evidence $e$ for $q$ was shown, e.g., ``Dinner is usually ready around 6pm. You look at the clock and it is 6pm.'' Finally, participants were asked about the probability of $q$, e.g., ``How likely is it that dinner is ready?'' and adjusted the slider accordingly. There were four different $q$ that appeared in the ``How likely is it that $q$?'' frame:

\begin{exe}
	\ex it is raining
	\ex the coffee is cold
	\ex dinner is ready
	\ex the neighbor's dog is barking
\end{exe}

For each \emph{q}, each participant evaluated one of five possible pieces of evidence, resulting in four trials per participant. Trial order was randomized. 

Pieces of evidence were generated by taking a version of the top five most frequently generated explanations from a separate experiment in which $q$ was given to participants and they were asked to provide a free response explanation of how the speaker knows about $q$.\footnote{This experiment can be viewed \href{http://stanford.edu/~jdegen/68_modals_freeproduction/modals.html}{here}.} The full list of pieces of evidence for each $q$ can be found in \appref{sec:evidence}.

For the German version, the procedure was identical; all materials were translated into German. See \appref{sec:evidence} for the full list of stimuli.

\subsection{Results and discussion}

We obtained between 3 and 14 ratings for each piece of evidence. We interpret the slider value between 0 (``impossible'') and 1 (``absolutely certain'') as a participant's estimate of the probability of $q$, given $e$, which we will also sometimes refer to as  \emph{evidence strength}. A histogram of mean evidence strengths for English and German is shown in \figref{fig:evidencestrength}.  We used these evidence strength ratings in the design and analyses of Experiments 2 and 3.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{pics/evidencestrength-histograms}
\caption{Histogram of by-item evidence strength means  for English (left) and German (right).}
\label{fig:evidencestrength}
\end{figure}


To test whether the English and German distributions of strength ratings differed, we conducted a mixed-effects linear regression predicting evidence strength rating from a dummy-coded fixed effect of language (with English as reference level) as well as by-participant and by-item random intercepts and by-item random slopes for language. The effect of language did not reach significance ($\beta$ = -.01, $SE$ = .03, $t$ = -.22, $p <$ .83), suggesting that the two populations did not differ in their estimates of evidence strength.   

\section{Experiment 2: production}


Next, we evaluated speakers' intuitions in a forced production task, testing how likely they are to use a particular form to communicate their belief about $q$ when given different pieces of evidence.\footnote{The English version of this experiment can be viewed \href{http://stanford.edu/~jdegen/71_modals_forced_production/modals.html}{here}.} The German version was identical with the exception that it was conducted in German and contained slightly different utterance choices.\footnote{The German version of this experiment can be viewed \href{http://web.stanford.edu/~jdegen/cgi-bin/3_dp_production/modals.html}{here}.}

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}

For the English version, we recruited 40 participants from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. For the German version, we recruited 40 participants on the German crowd-sourcing service Clickworker. Participants were compensated with a small payment.

\subsubsection{Materials and procedure}

Participants were presented with a piece of evidence (e.g., ``You see a person come in from outside with wet hair and wet clothes'') and were asked to choose one of four possible utterances to describe the situation to a friend. On each trial, they first saw a context sentence which varied by domain, e.g., ``Imagine that you are sitting in a room.'' Next, they were presented with a piece of evidence, e.g., ``Earlier today, you saw dark clouds in the sky.'' Finally, each participant saw the same question: ``Given what you know, what do you say to a friend who is sitting in a windowless room down the hall?'' They then chose one of four possible utterances by checking a radio button, e.g., ``It's raining,’’ ``It must be raining,’’ ``It's probably raining,’’ ``It might be raining.’’ Across domains, each choice was between utterances of the forms shown in \eref{utterancechoices}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex\label{utterancechoices} \emph{Abstract form of utterance choices:}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex $q$ (bare)
		\ex \emph{must q} (must)
		\ex \emph{probably q} (probably)
		\ex \emph{might q} (might)
		\end{xlist}
		\end{exe}
		
Each participant completed 12 trials, three per domain. For each participant and domain, three pieces of evidence were randomly sampled from the set of five. Trial order was randomized, as was the order of utterance options.

The procedure for German was identical. As for participants' utterance choices, we included bare $q$ form and \emph{must q} as in the English version, but instead of the modals \emph{probably} and \emph{might}, we included the modal adverbial \emph{vermutlich} (English \emph{presumably}) and the discourse particle \emph{wohl}.

\subsection{Results and discussion}

The overall distribution of utterance choices is shown in \figref{fig:utterances}. In both English and German, the bare form is used most frequently. In English, \emph{might} is also used frequently, with both \emph{must} and \emph{probably} being chosen at only half the rate. In German, the other forms were only chosen half as often, and indeed, \emph{muss q} is dispreferred in general.

The main question of interest in production is whether the choice of form to communicate about $q$ depends on the strength of the evidence for $q$. Indeed it does: \figref{fig:utterances-estrength} shows the mean strength of the evidence (as elicited in Exp.~1) that participants were given as a function of the utterance they ultimately chose.   In order to evaluate the effect of evidence strength on utterance choice, we conducted two separate mixed-effects linear regressions -- one for the English data, one for the German data -- predicting evidence strength from a dummy-coded predictor for utterance choice. In both cases, \emph{must}/\emph{muss} served as reference level. The models included random by-participant and by-item  intercepts. Evidence strength was greater when the bare form was produced than when \emph{must/muss q} was produced in both English ($\beta$ = .11, $SE$ = .01, $t$ = 7.58, $p <$ .0001) and German ($\beta$ = .12, $SE$ = .03, $t$ = 4.78, $p <$ .0001). In English, evidence   was weaker  when \emph{might q} was produced  ($\beta$ = -.13, $SE$ = .01, $t$ = -8.99, $p <$ .0001). There was no difference in evidence strength between \emph{must q} and \emph{probably q}  ($\beta$ = -.01, $SE$ = .02, $t$ = -.73, $p <$ .47). In German, evidence was weaker when \emph{vermutlich q} was produced  ($\beta$ = -.09, $SE$ = .03, $t$ = -3.35, $p <$ .0009). Interestingly, there was no difference in evidence strength between \emph{muss q} and \emph{wohl q}  ($\beta$ = -.02, $SE$ = .03, $t$ = -.67, $p <$ .51).

\label{fig:utterances-estrength}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Discussion}
We interpret these results as follows. In German, due to the lexical inventory of discourse particles, speakers have a choice of using epistemic adverbs such as \emph{vermutlich}, epistemic \emph{muss}, and particles like \emph{wohl}. As \figref{fig:utterances-estrength} shows, speakers tend to use \emph{muss} and \emph{wohl} instead of the respective adverb when the degree of evidence strength is higher. In other words, when investigating the dependence on evidence strength for \emph{q}, we find that \emph{muss} and \emph{wohl} pattern together, in contrast to other modal means such as \emph{vermutlich}. This is in line with what we introduced in Section 1. In particular, discourse particles, in contrast to modal adverbs, do not add epistemic uncertainty to the presupposition of an utterance. That is, the particle leaves the asserted state of affairs untouched, and thus we could expect the speaker to be more committed to the truth of the proposition when using a particle than when using a synonymous adverb expressing weakened commitment. Given our results, it might be that epistemic \emph{must}/\emph{muss} also does not add the effect of weakened commitment to the presupposition of an utterance, as our sketch in Section 1 indicated. Rather, weakened speaker commitment in this case is derived by separate (and additional) interpretive mechanisms that account for the failed inference involved in interpreting epistemic \emph{must} (see Section 1).


\section{Experiment 3a: comprehension (listener belief)}


We next tested the other side of the communicative coin: depending on the utterance $u$ used to communicate about $q$, how strong is listeners' resulting belief in $q$, and what do they believe to be the strength of the evidence the speaker was in possession of when producing $u$?\footnote{The English version of this experiment can be viewed \href{http://stanford.edu/~jdegen/72_modals_comprehension_evidence_room/modals.html}{here} and the German version \href{http://web.stanford.edu/~jdegen/cgi-bin/2_dp_comprehension_listenerbelief/modals.html}{here}.} The English and German experiments were identical except for the language. In addition, the experiments differed in the target utterances presented to participants: English participants saw the set in \eref{utterancechoices},  German participants the one in \eref{gutterancechoices}.

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}

For the English version, we recruited 60 participants through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. 
For the German version, we recruited 60 participants through the German crowd-sourcing service Clickworker. Participants were compensated with a small payment.

\subsubsection{Materials and procedure}

Participants were presented with an utterance (e.g., ``It must be raining'') and asked to both rate the probability of the state of affairs \emph{q} obtaining (e.g., it is raining) and to select one out of five pieces of evidence that the speaker had about \emph{q} in making their utterance. On each trial, participants first saw two context sentences: ``You are in a windowless room. Your friend X walks in and says: […],’’ where ``X'' was a randomly generated name.\footnote{This was done to discourage effects of inferences about speaker-specific language use on interpretation.} Participants then saw one of the utterances from Exp.~2 that ``X'' produced, e.g., ``It must be raining.’’ They were asked ``How likely do you think it is that it is raining?'' and adjusted a slider with endpoints labeled ``impossible'' and ``certain'' in response. Once they thus submitted their belief in $q$, the five potential pieces of evidence previously used in Exps.~1 and 2 were shown and participants were asked to choose one by clicking a radio button in response to the question ``How do you think X knows about the rain?'' 

Participants provided one set of judgments for each domain, resulting in four trials per participant. Each participant saw each type of utterance (bare, must, probably, might)  across trials. Utterance types were randomly distributed across domains. Trial order was randomized, as was the order in which pieces of evidence were displayed.

In the German version, the procedure was identical, but materials were presented in German and the utterances participants observed were the ones used in the German version of Exp.~2.

\subsection{Results and discussion}

Two questions are of interest: first, does the probability of listener belief in $q$ vary as a function of the observed utterance? Second, does the strength of the evidence for $q$ inferred to be available to the speaker vary as a function of the observed utterance? To address the first question, we conducted a mixed effects linear regression predicting degree of belief in $q$ from a dummy-coded utterance predictor with \emph{must}/\emph{muss} as reference level, separately for English and German. The model included random by-participant and by-item intercepts. Fig.~\ref{fig:expt3} shows mean probability of listener belief in $q$ by utterance: participants believed \emph{q} was more likely after observing the bare utterance than after observing the \emph{must} utterance in both English  ($\beta$=.24, \emph{SE}=0.03, \emph{t}=9.1, \emph{q}$<$0.0001) and German ($\beta$=.22, \emph{SE}=0.03, \emph{t}=7.5, \emph{q}$<$0.0001). In contrast, in English they believed $q$ was less likely after observing \emph{might q} ($\beta$=-.09, \emph{SE}=0.03, \emph{t}=-3.44, \emph{q}$<$0.0008). There was no difference in resulting listener belief between \emph{must q} and \emph{probably q} ($\beta$=-.04, \emph{SE}=0.03, \emph{t}=-1.6, \emph{q}$<$0.12). And in German, there were no differences in degree of belief in $q$ between \emph{muss q} and \emph{vermutlich q} ($\beta$=-.02, \emph{SE}=0.03, \emph{t}=-.76, \emph{q}$<$.46) nor between \emph{muss q} and \emph{wohl q} ($\beta$=.01, \emph{SE}=0.03, \emph{t}=.43, \emph{q}$<$.67). These results mirror the evidence strength effects found in production (Exp.~2), where we found that speakers tend to use epistemic \emph{must}, \emph{muss} instead of corresponding modals when the degree of evidence strength is higher.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pics/mean-beliefs}
	\caption{Mean probability of listener and speaker belief in $q$ by utterance for English (left) and German (right). Error bars indicate 95\% bootstrapped confidence intervals.}
	\label{fig:expt3}
\end{figure}

To address whether inferred speaker evidence strength mirrors the production results, we conducted another mixed effects linear regression, predicting inferred strength of evidence for $q$ from a dummy-coded utterance predictor with \emph{must}/\emph{muss} as reference level, separately for English and German. The model included random by-participant and by-item intercepts.  \figref{fig:exp3-evidence} shows mean evidence strength ascribed to speakers by utterance: interestingly, in English participants inferred stronger evidence was available to the speaker after observing the bare utterance than \emph{must q} ($\beta$=.08, \emph{SE}=.02, \emph{t}=3.74, \emph{q}$<$ .0003), but inferred evidence strength was no different for \emph{probably q} ($\beta$=.01, \emph{SE}=0.02, \emph{t}=.55, \emph{q}$<$ .59) or \emph{might q} ($\beta$=-.02, \emph{SE}=0.02, \emph{t}=-.89, \emph{q}$<$ .38). In German, participants inferred stronger evidence was available to the speaker after observing the bare utterance than \emph{muss q} ($\beta$=.08, \emph{SE}=.02, \emph{t}=3.23, \emph{q}$<$ .002). In addition, they inferred that the available evidence must have been weaker upon observing \emph{vermutlich q} ($\beta$=-.05, \emph{SE}=.02, \emph{t}=-2.1, \emph{q}$<$ .04), but inferred evidence strength was no different for \emph{wohl q} ($\beta$=.001, \emph{SE}=0.02, \emph{t}=.07, \emph{q}$<$ .95). This shows again that \emph{wohl} patterns with epistemic \emph{muss}, as we already observed in the context of production in Section 3.

\end{figure}

\section{Experiment 3b: comprehension (speaker commitment)}


Exp.~3a tested listener beliefs in $q$ as a function of the observed utterance. A related, but orthogonal dimension is the commitment that listeners ascribe to speakers as a basis for producing a particular utterance. For example, a particular utterance may lead the listener to infer that the speaker is highly committed to $q$, while nevertheless not instilling the same degree of belief in $q$ in the listener. In fact, epistemic \emph{must} has been claimed to function like this: \cite{vonfintelgillies2010} claim that maximal speaker commitment is necessary for the use of epistemic \emph{must}, just as in the use of the bare form; yet in comprehension the interpretation of \emph{must q} is weaker than that of bare $q$.  Exp.~E.3b thus tested the degree of belief in $q$ that listeners ascribe to \emph{speakers} depending on the utterance the speaker produced.\footnote{This experiment can be viewed \href{http://stanford.edu/~jdegen/80_modals_comprehension_speakerbelief/modals.html}{here}. The German version can be viewed \href{http://web.stanford.edu/~jdegen/cgi-bin/1_dp_comprehension_speakerbelief/discourse_particles.html}{here}.}

\subsection{Methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}

We recruited 60 English native speakers through Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and 60 German native speakers through Clickworker. Participants were compensated with a small payment.

\subsubsection{Materials and procedure}

The design, procedure, and materials were identical to those of Exp.~3a with the exception of the dependent measure: instead of asking participants how likely they thought that $q$, they instead answered the question ``Does X think that it's raining?'' by adjusting a slider on a scale with endpoints labeled ``Definitely not'' and ``Definitely.’’ 

\subsection{Results and discussion}

As in Exp.~3a, two questions are of interest: first, does the probability of  belief in $q$ -- this time, as ascribed to the speaker rather than as the result of the listener's interpretation --  vary as a function of the observed utterance? Second, does the strength of the evidence for $q$ inferred to be available to the speaker vary as a function of the observed utterance? To address the first question, we conducted a mixed effects linear regression predicting degree of belief in $q$ from a dummy-coded utterance predictor with \emph{must}/\emph{muss} as reference level, separately for English and German. The model included random by-participant and by-item intercepts. Fig.~\ref{fig:expt3} shows mean probability of ascribed speaker belief in $q$ by utterance: participants believed the speaker was more likely to believe \emph{q}  after observing the bare utterance than after observing the \emph{must} utterance in both English   ($\beta$=.18, \emph{SE}=0.03, \emph{t}=6.59, \emph{q}$<$0.0001) and German ($\beta$=.19, \emph{SE}=0.03, \emph{t}=5.79, \emph{q}$<$ .0001). In contrast, they believed the speaker was less likely to believe $q$ if they produced \emph{probably q} ($\beta$=-.14, \emph{SE}=0.03, \emph{t}=-5.28, \emph{q}$<$0.0001) or \emph{might q} ($\beta$=-.22, \emph{SE}=0.03, \emph{t}=-8.36, \emph{q}$<$0.0001). In German, participants believed the speaker was less likely to believe $q$ if they produced \emph{vermutlich q} ($\beta$=-.1, \emph{SE}=0.03, \emph{t}=-3.01, \emph{q}$<$0.004). There was no difference between \emph{muss q} and \emph{wohl q} ($\beta$=-.02, \emph{SE}=0.03, \emph{t}=-.61, \emph{q}$<$ .55).  This shows, similar to what we found in the domain of production, that speaker commitment in the case of both epistemic \emph{must} and discourse particles is stronger than in the case of using otherwise synonymous adverbs such as \emph{vermutlich}.

Taken together, these results mirror the effects found in Exp.~3a, with the exception that all utterances led to differences in ascribed speaker commitment. Interestingly, the strength of the belief that participants attributed to speakers was stronger than their own resulting belief. This was borne out statistically in a model that was applied to both the listener and speaker belief datasets. This model was identical to that just reported, but additionally allowed for a dummy-coded belief holder predictor (listener vs.~speaker)  to interact with utterance. There was a clear main effect of belief holder, such that the belief ascribed to speakers was stronger than that held by listener participants, both in English ($\beta$=.14, \emph{SE}=0.03, \emph{t}=4.7, \emph{q}$<$0.0001) and in German ($\beta$=.08, \emph{SE}=0.04, \emph{t}=2.23, \emph{q}$<$ .03). 

As in Exp.~3a, to address whether inferred speaker evidence strength mirrors production, we conducted another mixed effects linear regression, predicting inferred strength of evidence for $q$ from a dummy-coded utterance predictor with \emph{must} as reference level. The model included random by-participant and by-item intercepts.  \figref{fig:exp3-evidence} shows mean evidence strength ascribed to speakers by utterance:  again, participants inferred stronger evidence was available to the speaker after observing the bare utterance than \emph{must/muss q} in both English ($\beta$=.06, \emph{SE}=.02, \emph{t}=3.2, \emph{q}$<$ .002) and German ($\beta$=.08, \emph{SE}=.02, \emph{t}=4.05, \emph{q}$<$ .0001). However, inferred evidence strength was no different in English for \emph{probably q} ($\beta$=-.02, \emph{SE}=0.02, \emph{t}=-1.11, \emph{q}$<$ .27) or \emph{might q} ($\beta$=-.01, \emph{SE}=0.02, \emph{t}=-.49, \emph{q}$<$ .63); nor in German for \emph{vermutlich q} ($\beta$=-.0003, \emph{SE}=.02, \emph{t}=-.02, \emph{q}$<$ .99) or \emph{wohl q} ($\beta$=.008, \emph{SE}=0.02, \emph{t}=.36, \emph{q}$<$ .72).

Allowing this model to interact with a belief holder predictor and applying it simultaneously to the Exp.~3a dataset yields no main effect of belief holder in either English ($\beta$=.03, \emph{SE}=.02, \emph{t}=1.53, \emph{q}$<$ .13) or German ($\beta$=.0008, \emph{SE}=0.03, \emph{t}=.04, \emph{q}$<$ .97) -- this is unsurprising and serves as a sanity check for the belief holder effect, given that this aspect of the dependent measure was identical across experiments.


\section{General discussion and outlook}

In this squib, we presented a series of experiments focusing on the extent to which listeners' interpretation of certain types of modals and their judgments about speaker commitment differ in strength compared to the epistemic use of \emph{must}, to the use of discourse particles, and to statements with no modals at all. Moreover, we demonstrated that speakers' production preferences for these different devices mirror the comprehension results, given varying evidential circumstances.

Our results confirm differences claimed in the literature on expressing different strengths of speaker commitment. In particular, (i) the epistemic use of \emph{must}/\emph{muss} expresses a weaker commitment than the bare form and (ii) the use of the discourse particle \emph{wohl} conveys a stronger commitment than otherwise synonymous modal adverbs. However, in addition to experimentally confirming these well-established claims from the literature, we also illustrated interesting parallel effects of epistemic \emph{must}/\emph{muss} and the discourse particle \emph{wohl} — both in production and in comprehension. This might shed some new light on traditional assumptions: we suggest that these two devices pattern in many respects because both epistemic  \emph{must}/\emph{muss} and discourse particles involve a different interpretive route that listeners must take in order to arrive at the relevant reading of weakened speaker commitment.

As for the case of \emph{wohl}, the listener interprets \emph{wohl} as belonging to the domain of ‘use-conditional content’ (Recanati 2004), that is, to content that differs from ‘truth-conditional content’ in being not challengeable. In terms of presuppositional semantics, the particle leaves the asserted state of affairs untouched, and thus we expect the speaker to be more committed to the truth of the proposition when using a particle than when using a synonymous adverb expressing weakened commitment. As for the case of epistemic \emph{must}, our experiments lend support to the idea that \emph{must} crucially differs from other modal devices such as \emph{might} and \emph{probably}. The fact that \emph{must} in German patterns with use-conditional expressions like discourse particles might suggest an account of epistemic \emph{must} that refrains from engineering the effect of weakness into the descriptive content of the utterance and assumes that the notorious weakening effect is part of a non-propositional domain of utterance interpretation. Let us be more specific about what we have in mind here. The relatively weak interpretation of \emph{must} does not require encoding weakness or indirectness into the semantics of modals. Under the assumption that the cost of uttering \emph{must q} is greater than the bare form, listeners infer both (i) that the probability of \emph{q} is smaller than when the utterance is the less costly bare $q$ and (ii) that the speaker has less than maximally strong evidence for $q$. Thus, the semantics of \emph{must} remains strong and pragmatics does the job of weakening.

All in all, we hope that our experimental squib provides a good starting point for approaching theoretical debates on the nature of evidential expressions empirically.
